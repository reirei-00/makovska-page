# Makovska Page

Personal website for Viktoriia Makovska.

## Structure
- `about/` — main profile page
- `research/` — publications and citations
- `teaching/` — teaching and courses
- `assets/` — styles, scripts, images, and CV

## Development
Links and assets are rooted at `/makovska-page/` for GitHub Pages. For local preview, run a local server that serves this repo at that path (or temporarily switch the `<base>` tags back to a relative path).

## Deployment (GitHub Pages)
This is a project site. After pushing to `main`, it should be available at:
`https://reirei-00.github.io/makovska-page/`
